## About the Web Platform Team at Adobe

Adobe makes tools that enable designers and developers to share their creativity with the world. The advent of sophisticated graphical and interactive features has made it possible for the web to deliver highly engaging experiences. For Adobe, that means the need for new creative tools and services.

Adobe believes that the web platform will deliver all the rich experiences that authors want and need. Adobe is helping make this vision a reality through its contributions of creative features such as advanced layout and cinematic effects to web standards and HTML rendering engines. In addition, Adobe is building the best tools and services in the world to enable web designers who code and developers who value design to create beautiful mobile-ready content and apps.

## The web has become the platform for creative expression

Adobe has a long history in delivering technologies that allow creatives to express themselves and connect with millions of people.

A web that has a strong foundation built to support creative features is vital to Adobe's efforts to serve its users, allowing them to use this medium to freely express themselves. A more expressive web creates new opportunities for Adobe to build great tools and services to create beautiful content.

And Adobe's tools and services are increasingly built and delivered on the web platform itself, which makes the web platform features, design and robustness a key to Adobe's success.

## Adobe is helping the web move forward

The web platform has evolved significantly over the last decade. It can be used to deliver experiences that are richer, more interactive and more engaging than ever before. But there is still work to be done. Adobe is moving the web forward by engaging and participating with the web community, including web standards groups, browser vendors, open source project contributors and content creators. There are a few specific areas we are focusing on:

*Robust graphical foundation*: sometimes it's the little things that can make a big difference. Adobe wants to make sure that the basic elements that graphic designers use in tools like Photoshop® and Illustrator® are also available on the web. It is working to bring blend modes and sophisticated compositing to the web. And it is ensuring that geometric transformations and animations work consistently across HTML, CSS and SVG to make it easy to use more complex graphical effects.

*Magazine-like layout*: based on Adobe's experience with tools like InDesign®, it's important to provide web designers the same kind of sophisticated layout and rich typography that print has afforded them to date. Adobe has made several proposals to the W3C to help achieve this goal, including CSS Regions and CSS Shapes and has contributed implementations of these proposals to the WebKit project. CSS Regions is now available in Chrome and in Internet Explorer 10.

*Cinematic visual effects*: Adobe tools proved that sophisticated and compelling visual effects for more engaging user experiences. Adobe is working with the community on proposals to bring experiences to the web, starting with CSS Custom Filters to bring hardware accelerated graphical filters and visual effects to the web.

*Typography*: Adobe has a long tradition and deep expertise in typography. Adobe's contributions include some beautiful open source fonts, Source Sans Pro and Source Code Pro, that have been fine-tuned for use on the web, as well as a library of free fonts available through Adobe Edge Web Fonts.

*Consistency*: the openness and diversity of implementation of web standards is an important characteristic of the web. But it's also important for authors to be able to rely on consistent results from these implementations. Adobe is working with the web community to make this happen. A good example of this is the successful series of Test the Web Forward events that are helping make sure that the browsers implement web standards consistently.

We’re here as a conduit for designers and developers with big ideas of what the web is and can be. So, let us know where you want the web to go. Let’s create the web together!
