#Pull Quotes

##What is it?

A pull quote is a typographical element in which an excerpt of an article's content is duplicated inside the article to emphasise an idea and to incite the interest of readers. The pull quote is usually styled differently than the rest of the article, with a larger font than the body and positioned to stand out in the page.

The pull quote concept should not be confused with the block quote concept. A pull quotes is purely a graphic elements that shouldn't appear inside the main content of the article. On the other hand, a block quote is a visual technique that's used to display a quotation as a part of the article's flow.
