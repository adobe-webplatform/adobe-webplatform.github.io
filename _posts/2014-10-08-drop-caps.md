#Drop Caps

##What is it?

<span class="dropcap">A</span> typographic pattern that [predates printing](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/medieval/images/hunayn.jpg){:target="_blank"}, 
drop caps - also known as initial capitals - are letters at the beginning of the first word of a chapter 
or paragraph that is larger than the rest of the text. They are both decorative and used to highlight
the beginning of a new section; for instance, at the beginning of a chapter, or a new part of 
a long-form article.

Drop caps remain very common in print - including magazines - but are relatively rare
on the web. This is likely due to the difficulty of reliably aligning the initial letter
with the adjoining text according to typographic convention. The drop cap's baseline, for
instance, must align with the baseline of one of the its paragraph's lines. But the exact
position of the latter is a function of which font family the browser uses at runtime.

A typical CSS drop cap will look like this:

<figure id="drop-cap-align-image">
  <a href="http://dauwhe.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">
  <img src="/img/dropcaps/css-drop-cap.png" alt="An unaligned CSS drop cap"></img>
  </a>
  <figcaption>

</figure>

For best results, the initial letter should be aligned with the adjoining text:

<figure id="css-drop-cap-image">
  <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-inline/#DropInitial" target="_blank">
  <img src="/img/dropcaps/dropcap-lines.png" alt="How a two-line drop cap aligns with its adjoining paragraph"></img>
  </a>

##When can I use it?

<span class="dropcap">T</span>he initial-letter property is defined [in the working draft of the CSS Inline Layout module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-inline/#DropInitial){:target="_blank"}. [WebKit Nightly](http://nightly.webkit.org/){:target="_blank"} currently supports the feature.

For other browsers, [dropcap.js](http://webplatform.adobe.com/dropcap.js/){:target="_blank"} exposes the same feature set as initial-letter.
