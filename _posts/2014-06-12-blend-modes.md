#CSS Compositing and Blending

##What is it?

The [Compositing and Blending Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/){:target="_blank"} specification brings to the web platform the advanced blending modes that control how colors mix in areas where shapes overlap.

You’re probably familiar with advanced blend modes from Photoshop: color, color-burn, color-dodge, darken, difference, exclusion, hard-light, hue, lighten, luminosity, multiply, normal, overlay, saturation, screen, soft-light.

While some basic compositing has been available on the web via CSS & SVG from a while back, this new functionality provides capabilities similar to those in Photoshop directly to the web via CSS.

##Where can I learn more?

As Dudley Storey says in [PhotoShop In The Browser: Understanding CSS Blend Modes](http://demosthenes.info/blog/707/PhotoShop-In-The-Browser-Understanding-CSS-Blend-Modes){:target="_blank"}, you could just keep choosing from the list of modes until the result looks good. Or you could read his article to get an overview of the different kinds of blend modes. Also check out [Getting to know CSS Blend Modes](http://dev.opera.com/articles/getting-to-know-css-blend-modes/){:target="_blank"} by Shwetank Dixit.

To deepen your understanding, do check out the [The Compositing and Blending Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/){:target="_blank"} spec. There are a lot of examples to help clarify the technical talk.
