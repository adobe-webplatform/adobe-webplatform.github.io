#CSS Blend Modes Compositing

##What is it?

Some basic compositing is available in CSS & SVG, from a while back.

And you’re probably familiar with advanced blend modes from Photoshop: color, color-burn, color-dodge, darken, difference, exclusion, hard-light, hue, lighten, luminosity, multiply, normal, overlay, saturation, screen, soft-light.

The [Compositing and Blending Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/) specification brings to the web platform the advanced blending modes that control how colors mix in areas where shapes overlap.

##When can I use it?

Now in Chrome & Firefox and soon in Safari 8. For a view of current and upcoming browser support, check out [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=blend-mode).

##Where can I learn more?

As Dudley Storey says in [PhotoShop In The Browser: Understanding CSS Blend Modes](http://demosthenes.info/blog/707/PhotoShop-In-The-Browser-Understanding-CSS-Blend-Modes), you could just keep choosing from the list of modes until the result looks good. Or you could read his article to get an overview of the different kinds of blend modes. Also check out [Getting to know CSS Blend Modes](http://dev.opera.com/articles/getting-to-know-css-blend-modes/) by Shwetank Dixit.

To deepen your understanding, do check out the [The Compositing and Blending Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/) spec. There are a lot of examples to help clarify the technical talk.
