#CSS Regions

##What is it?
With regions, you can use CSS properties to flow content into existing styled containers, specifying any container order you choose, regardless of their position on the page. Using regions, you can create visually appealing responsive layouts both for mobile and desktop content.

The Adobe Web Platform team is contributing to the [CSS Regions Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-regions/) specification, which aims to bring the powerful concepts of named flows and regions to the HTML world.

CJ Gammon's article [Killer Responsive Layouts With CSS Regions](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/05/killer-responsive-layouts-with-css-regions/) provides a nice overview of CSS Regions concepts. In her article [CSS Regions Matter](http://sarasoueidan.com/blog/css-regions-matter/), Sara Soueidan notices that CSS Regions are a fragmentation feature and analyses some interesting use cases for them.

Our samples of [regions on codepen.io](http://codepen.io/collection/jabto/) are there to help you understand the basic CSS Regions concepts. For some interesting regions demos, check out Tyler Fry's [reading carousel](http://codepen.io/frytyler/pen/wdecC) made out of regions and transforms, and Joshua Hibbert's [exploding book](http://codepen.io/joshnh/pen/KyxtH) featuring a nice hover effect when opening the book.
