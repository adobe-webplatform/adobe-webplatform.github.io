#CSS Clipping & Masking

##What is it?

Clipping takes a region of an element and prevents rendering - the element gets "clipped." Masking is using an image as coverage over an element, affecting the alpha channel of the element. Portions of a masked element are fully or partially transparent, and so the effect really comes from a combination of an element and the masking image.

The Adobe Web Platform team is contributing to the [CSS Masking Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/) specification, which aims to bring these two operations to the HTML world.

##When can I use it?

##Where can I learn more?

[Razvan Caliman](http://razvancaliman.com/) provides a clear distinction between masking and clipping in his [Intro to CSS Masking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3h5OetmSI) video. In it, he points to an article by [Dirk Schulze](https://twitter.com/dirkschulze): [CSS Masking](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/).
