#Clipping & Masking

##What is it?

Clipping takes a region of an element and prevents rendering - the element gets "clipped." Masking is using an image as coverage over an element, affecting the alpha channel of the element. Portions of a masked element are fully or partially transparent, and so the effect really comes from a combination of an element and the masking image.

The Adobe Web Platform team is contributing to the [CSS Masking Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/){:target="_blank"} specification, which aims to bring these two operations to the HTML world.
