#Clipping

##What is it?

Clipping takes a region of an element and prevents rendering - the element gets "clipped." Clipping is similar to [masking]({{site.baseurl}}/masking/) in that they are both used to
define what is visible. The difference is that clipping uses predefined shapes to achieve this and masking uses images.

The Adobe Web Platform team is contributing to the [CSS Masking Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/){:target="_blank"} specification, which aims to bring clipping
and masking to the HTML world.

##When can I use it?
{% assign browser_support = site.data.browser_support.clip-path %}
{% include browser-support.html %}

Now in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. For a view of current and upcoming browser support, check out [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=clip-path){:target="_blank"}.

##Where can I learn more?

[Razvan Caliman](http://razvancaliman.com/){:target="_blank"} provides a clear distinction between masking and clipping in his [Intro to CSS Masking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3h5OetmSI){:target="_blank"} video.
