#Masking

##What is it?

Masking is using an image as coverage over an element, affecting the alpha channel of the element. Portions of a masked element are fully or partially transparent, and so the effect really comes from a combination of an element and the masking image. Masking is similar to [clipping]({{site.baseurl}}/clipping/) in that they are both used to define what is visible. 
Masking uses an image for this and clipping uses shapes.

The Adobe Web Platform team is contributing to the [CSS Masking Module Level 1](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/css-masking-1/){:target="_blank"} specification, which aims to bring masking and
clipping to the HTML world.

##When can I use it?

{% assign browser_support = site.data.browser_support.mask %}
{% include browser-support.html %}

Now in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. For a view of current and upcoming browser support, check out [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=mask){:target="_blank"}.

##Where can I learn more?

[Razvan Caliman](http://razvancaliman.com/){:target="_blank"} provides a clear distinction between masking and clipping in his [Intro to CSS Masking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV3h5OetmSI){:target="_blank"} video. In it, he points to an article by [Dirk Schulze](https://twitter.com/dirkschulze){:target="_blank"}: [CSS Masking](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/masking/adobe/){:target="_blank"}.
